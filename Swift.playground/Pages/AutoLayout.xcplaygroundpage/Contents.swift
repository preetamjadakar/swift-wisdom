 ## The *intrinsic size* of an element is the size it would be based on its content, if no external factors were applied to it.
 
 # Content hugging priority:
    - Sets the priority with which a view resists being made larger than its intrinsic size. Setting a larger value to this priority indicates that we don’t want the view to grow larger than its content.
    - So, larger the content hugging priority , the views bound will hug to the intrinsic content more tightly preventing the view to grow beyond its intrinsic content size.
 
 # Content compression resistance priority:
    - Sets the priority with which a view resists being made smaller than its intrinsic size. Setting a higher value means that we don’t want the view to shrink smaller than the intrinsic content size.
    - Higher the priority means larger the resistance to get shrunk.
