 # Vulnerabilities and precautions
1. Session management and OAuth for user authentication
2. Data encryption/decryption:
3. Automated unit, integration and acceptance testing based on the mobile app security verification standard
 4. Data storage and Privacy requirements:
 Use of keychain or secure key store by OS

 Detect Jailbroken or Rooted device

 Binary Protection:
 Code obfuscation: encrypting sensitive coding data
 Detect screen recording or mirroring service

 Detect native keyboard to avoid key logger and key stroke attacks

 App detects use of reverse engineering tools and tampering of code/data

 Secure Coding Techniques
 Platform interaction guidelines
 Avoid exploitable coding flaws

 
 # AES Encryption/Decryptoin:
 - Symetric key encryption means a single secrete key is shared between sender and receiver
 - AES data encryption is a more mathematically efficient and elegant cryptographic algorithm, but its main strength rests in the option for various key lengths. AES allows you to choose a 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key, making it exponentially stronger than the 56-bit key of DES.
 
 # RSA Encryption/Decryption: used
 - Asymetric key encryption means a separate secrete keys are shared between sender and receiver
 Encryption: using public key of receiver
 Decryption: using private key of self
